    and B. Both specimens reveal an aplastic proliferation of. oligodendrocytes with
    different degrees of cellularity and cytological. atypia. In some areas, the tumor
    is well differentiated and the. neoplastic cells display well defined cell borders
    and typical peri-. nuclear halos. In these areas, the cellularity is low and there
    is no. significant mitotic activity. However, most of the tumor consists of. areas
    of higher cellularity, with more pronounced nuclear pleomorphism. and readily
    identified mitotic figures. The stromal vessels in these. areas display endothelial
    hyperplasia. Except for one area present in. the frozen section control slide,
    there are no extensive foci of. necrosis. The tumor infiltrates the cortex in
    many areas and reveals. neoplastic satellitosis around non-neoplastic cortical
    neurons. There. is also evidence of previous hemorrhage within the tumor and numerous.
    interstitial calcifications are also present. In some areas, the. tumor. completely
    replaces the entire gyri and produces subpial aggregates on. adjacent gyri. In
    summary, the findings are those of an anaplastic oligodendroglioma. The grade
    in the tumor is anaplastic as based on the high degree of. cellularity, nuclear
    pleomorphism and mitotic activity in several. areas. of the tumor. In the Smith
    Grading System for oligodendrogliomas. these areas of anaplasia would received

    and white mater extensively. infiltrated. by a neoplasm with morphological features
    similar to those described. for the previous specimen. However in less infiltrated
    areas of the. cortex, where abundant neuropil is still identifiable, the neoplastic.
    cells display naked round nuclei, not infrequently surrounded by a. clear halo.
    Mitotic figures are difficult to be identified, and. microvascular cellular proliferation
    or necrosis are absent. 3. Sections from the central nodular portion of the lesion.
    demonstrate. focal areas with a frank astrocytic phenotype next to nodular areas
    of. oligodendroglioma made-up of tumor cells with large, hyperchromatic. nuclei
    surrounded by halos and well defined cell membranes. In the. central area of the
    specimen, there are irregularly shaped cystic. spaces surrounded by rarified white
    matter with neoplastic glial cells. and focal secretion of mucinous material.
    These spaces become. confluent and form larger cysts. The entire specimen is permeated.
    throughout by neoplastic cells with oligodendroglial characteristics. usually
    with some preservation of the neuropil or white matter,. occasionally with formation
    of nodules. In relationship with the more. cellular areas, there are vessels cuffed
    by mononuclear inflammatory. cells, which are seen permeating the wall of some
    of these vessels. Mitotic figures are difficult to be found, and areas of microvascular.
    cellular proliferation or necrosis are absent. The tumor is present. in. all margins
    of resection. SPECIAL STAINS: MIB-1 immunoperoxidase stain was performed on blocks.
    1. and 8. A MIB-1 labelling index of 1% was determined on block #8. representing
    the bulk of the neoplasm. A labelling index of 8% was. determined in one focal
    hypercellular area, block #1. COMMENT: The lesion is a mixed glioma with an epicenter
    containing. areas of gemistocytic astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma, which. surround.
    portions of rarified white matter with sparsely infiltrating neoplasm. that have
    become cystic and confluent. From the epicenter, the tumor. is observed infiltrating
    the cerebral cortex and white matter as. individual cells with oligodendrocyte
    morphology and varying. cellularity. Neoplastic infiltration is reaching all margins
    of. resection. In the more cellular areas of tumor, there are. perivascular. lymphocytic
    infiltrates. In spite of the focal prominent cellularity. and. nuclear pleomorphism,
    mitotic figures are rare and miorovascular. cellular proliferation or areas of
    necrosis are absent. In this tumor, the oligodendroglioma is the predominant component,
    and. it is of low grade. However, the gemistocytic. component and the focal MIB-1
    labelling index of 8% are worrisome, as. they probably portend aggressive behavior.'

    by a neoplastic. proliferation. of glial cells. The neoplastic cells have rather
    small nuclei with. moderate nuclear pleomorphism, and diffusely permeate the white
    matter. and cortex with prominent perineuronal satellitosis and focal subpial.
    accumulation. Mitotic figures are occasionally seen, however,. microvascular cellular
    proliferation or necrosis is absent. B. Fragments of brain tissue extensively
    infiltrated by a neoplasm. similar to that described for part A. The cellularity
    is higher and. the nuclear pleomorphism is more prominent in this specimen, and.
    mitotic figures are also observed. Again, microvascular cellular. proliferation
    and necrosis are absent. C. Portions of brain tissue extensively infiltrated by
    a neoplasm. similar to that described for part A. D. Portions of hippocampus which
    are focally infiltrated by a. neoplasia similar to that described for part B,
    which is effacing the. dentate gyrus and pyramidal cell layer. SPECIAL STAINS:
    MIB-1 and factor VIII AA immunoperoxidase methods. were. preformed on blocks 5
    and 14. With the MIB-1, a labelling index of about 15% was determined on. section
    14 in areas of solid tumor. With the FVIII AA, no endothelial. microvascular proliferation
    was demonstrated. COMMENT: In all the four specimens, there is extensive infiltration.
    of. the gray and white matter by a fibrillary astrocytoma. The tumor. effaces
    the normal cortical architecture with the presence of. prominent. satellitosis
    and focal subpial accumulation. The neurons present. throughout the specimens
    are considered to be native entrapped. neurons,. not part of the neoplasm. The
    tumor is moderately cellular with. moderate nuclear pleomorphism, and is not difficult
    to find mitotic. figures. However, microvascular cellular proliferation and necrosis.
    are absent. The cellularity, degree of nuclear atypia and presence of. mitoses
    with a high MIB-1 labelling index of 15%, justify a diagnosis. of anaplastic astrocytoma.
    The absence of endothelial proliferation,. however, probably places this neoplasm
    at the low end of the spectrum. of anaplastic astrocytomas. TISSUE COMMITTEE CODE:

    Part A. This specimen is portions of cerebrum that are moderately infiltrated
    by a glial neoplastic proliferation that. has a. mixed oligo astrocytic phenotype,
    with uniform round/ovoid nuclei frequently surrounded by halos. However, the.
    neoplastic cells are devoid of the 1p, 19q deletion characteristic of oligodendrogliomas.
    Mitotic figures are. found with. great difficulty, and there is not microvascular
    proliferation or tumor necrosis. The MIB-1 proliferation. index is greater. than
    9% (as normal native cells are entered in the total nuclear count; the index is
    probably no more than. 15%). The findings are interpreted as those of a low histological
    grade glial neoplasm that has molecular. features of. astrocytoma. The elevated
    cycling activity may portend a heightened aggressive potential. Part B. This specimen
    is three small fragments of cerebral cortex in which, because of the small size
    and. orientation of the. fragments, it is difficult to evaluate the cortical architectural
    features. Furthermore, the IDH1 stain. demonstrates a. somewhat sparse sprinkling
    of the cortex by neoplastic glial cells, which interferes even more with. evaluation
    of the. distribution of normal cells. There is not obvious architectural distortion,
    dysmorphic neuronal element, or. balloon. cells. The findings are interpreted
    as a glial neoplasm sparsely infiltrating the cerebral cortex; and non. conclusive

    and/or. mutated. in up to 40% to 50% of patients. EGFR variant III (EGFRVIII)
    is an. oncogenic,. constitutively active mutant form of EGFR resulting from deletion
    of. exons. 2-7, which is commonly expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and
    in. vivo. models of glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRVIII as defining. prognostically.
    distinct subgroups of glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of. EGFRVIII.
    has been shown to sensitize tumors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. when the.
    tumor suppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin fixed,
    paraffin embedded tissue samples. and. reverse transcribed to cDNA. The cDNA is
    then amplified using standard. PCR. technique for DNA templates including the
    housekeeping genes for. testing RNA. integrity. PCR products are detected by gel

    The sections contain portions of cerebrum that are heavily. infiltrated/effaced.
    by a neoplastic proliferation of glial cells that have astrocyte-like. phenotype,
    but with rather uniform round nuclei and frequently with. perinuclear halos. There
    is brisk mitotic activity, with a high MIB-1. proliferation index of about 30%.
    There is prominent endothelial. hyperplasia,. and focal microvascular cellular
    proliferation. There is no tumor. necrosis. The features are those of an anaplastic
    oligodendroglioma. Results of molecular testing are reported below. PROCEDURES/ADDENDA.
    PCR for EGFR variant III mutation. Interpretation. NEGATIVE - No evidence of EGFRVIII
    mutation is detected. Results-Comments. TEST DESCRIPTION: Testing performed on
    RNA extracted from. H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed.
    The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive molecular. target.
    in glioblastoma because it is amplified, overexpressed, and/or mutated. in up.
    to 40% to 50% of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant. III. (EGFRvIII)
    is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR. that is. commonly
    expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of. glioblastoma have
    demonstrated EGFRVIII as defining prognostically. distinct. subgroups of glioblastomas.
    Additionally, the presence of EGFRVIII has. been. shown to sensitize tumors to
    EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the. tumor. suppressor protein PTEN is intact.
    RNA is extracted from formalin. fixed,. paraffin embedded tissue samples and reverse
    transcribed to cDNA. The. cDNA is. then amplified using standard PCR technique
    for DNA templates. PCR. products. are detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit
    of detection of this. assay has. been determined to be approximately 5 mutant
    cells in 100 normal. cells. FDA Comment: The above data are not to be construed
    as the results. from a. stand alone diagnostic test. This test was developed and
    its. performance. characteristies determined by the. laboratory as. required by
    CLIA ''88 regulations. It has not been cleared or approved. for. specific uses
    by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) The FDA. has. determined that such
    clearance or approval is not necessary. These. results are. provided for informational
    purposes only, and should be interpreted. only in. the context of established
    procedures and/or diagnostic criteria. MGMT Promoter Methylation. Interpretation.
    NEGATIVE: No evidence of methylated MGMT promoter is detected. Results-Comments.
    Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block. H and E slide was
    examined and no microdissection was needed. TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma
    containing a methylated MGMT. promoter. have been shown to benefit from therapy
    with alkylating agents. Assessment of. MGMT promoter methylation status involves
    bisulfite treatment of DNA. followed. by real-time PCR amplification (MethyLight)
    of methylated and. unmethylated DNA. sequences. The analytic sensitivity of this
    assay was determined by. serial. dilution of methylated positive control DNA into
    unmethylated DNA, and. was. assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background
    of unmethylated. DNA. Factors such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells
    in the. sample, or. extensive tissue necrosis, may preclude the detection of methylated.
    MGMT. promoter sequences. FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed
    as the results. from a. stand alone diagnostic test. This test was developed and
    its. performance. characteristics determined by the. laboratory as. required by

    the tumor is more. cellular and/or effaces the cerebral cortex. Throughout the
    tumor. mitotic activity and microvascular cellular proliferation are. inconspicuous.
    There are no areas of necrosis. This neoplasm is most. likely an oligodendroglioma
    or mixed oligoastrocytoma. However, it. may. also be diagnosed as a low grade
    astrocytoma, perhaps with. gemistocytic. features, or as a protoplasmic astrocytoma.'

    molecular target in glioblastoma because it. is amplified,. overexpressed, and/or
    mutated in up to 40% to 50% of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant.
    III. (EGFRvIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR that
    is commonly expressed in. glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of glioblastoma
    have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically. distinct. subgroups of
    glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFRvIII has been shown to sensitize
    tumors. to EGFR. tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the tumor suppressor protein
    PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from. formalin fixed,. paraffin embedded tissue
    samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The cDNA is then amplified using. standard

    NEGATIVE - No evidence of EGFRVIII mutation is detected. Results-Comments -. TEST
    DESCRIPTION: Testing performed on RNA extracted from tumor. paraffin block. The
    epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive molecular. target. in
    glioblastoma because it is amplified, overexpressed, and/or mutated. in up. to
    40% to 50% of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant. III. (EGFRVIII)
    is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR. that is. commonly
    expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of. glioblastoma have
    demonstrated EGFRVIII as defining prognostically. distinct. subgroups of glioblastomas.
    Additionally, the presence of EGFRVIII has. been. shown to sensitize tumors to
    EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the. tumor. suppressor protein PTEN is intact.
    RNA is extracted from formalin. fixed,. paraffin embedded tissue samples and reverse
    transcribed to CDNA. The. CDNA is. then amplified using standard PCR technique
    for DNA templates. PCR. products. are detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit
    of detection of this. assay has. been determined to be approximately 5 mutant
    cells in 100 normal. cells. FDA Comment: The above data are not to be construed
    as the results. from a. stand alone diagnostic test. This test was developed and
    its. performance. characteristics determined by the. as. required. It has not
    been cleared or approved. for. specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
    (FDA). The FDA. has. determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.

    TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT. promoter.
    have been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment of.
    MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA. followed.
    by real-time PCR amplification. E) of methylated and. unmethylated DNA. sequences.
    The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial. dilution of.
    methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and was. assessed to be.
    1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated DNA. Factors. such as.

    nucleolus. The background is. heavily fibrillary, and has a capillary-type vasculature.
    There are. mitotic figures, microvascular cellular proliferation, or necrosis.
    B. Portions of a glial neoplastic proliferation similar to that one. described
    for part A. In here, the neoplasm becomes more cellular,. the. nuclei become hyperchromatic
    and moderately pleomorphic, and. gemistocytic phenotype is present throughout

    The neoplasm is similar to that one described for. parts. A. and B. However, in
    here the neoplasm is less cellular, although. still has the anaplastic nuclear
    features. Mitotic figures although. present, are rather inconspicuous, and microvascular

    are focal prominent hypercellularity and nuclear anaplasia, very. sparse mitotic
    activity, low MIB-1 proliferation indices, and absent. microvascular cellular
    proliferation and necrosis. These. morphological. features suggest an anaplastic

    ANAPLASTIC,. DIFFUSELY INFILTRATING. Operation/Specimen Brain, right temporal
    lobe. Clinical History and Pre-Op Dx: Patient with several month history of. visual
    disturbances and headaches who has a CT scan lesion involving. the right temporal
    lobe and extending across the midline to the left. hemisphere. The differential
    diagnosis is between lymphoma and a. glioma. INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: Astrocytoma,
    anaplastic. GROSS PATHOLOGY: Specimen received in a container labeled with the.
    patient''s name and MRN. A portion of this specimen is used for the. intraoperative
    consultation and for fixation in glutaraldehyde for. eventual electron microscopy.
    The total amount of tissue removed. equals. approximately 5.0 g and all remaining
    fragments are submitted in six. tissue cassettes. MICROSCOPIC: Fragments of cerebral
    cortex and underlying white matter. showing multiple, focal and diffuse infiltrates
    by small neoplastic. cells that in general lack differentiation. In many areas
    the cells. surrund individual neurons and in small sites they show some degree
    of. cytoplasmic differentiation which appears similar to that of an. astrocyte.
    There are multiple perivascular nests of neoplastic cells. Areas of coagulation
    necrosis or atypical mitosis are not readily. identified, however the general
    impression is that this pattern of. tissue infiltrate may represent distant extension
    of a rather. aggressive type of undifferentiated neoplasm. In summary, the impression
    formed at the time of the intraoperative. consultation that this represents a
    small cell glioma with very. anaplastic features is sustained by the evidence
    available at this. time. In an attempt to further identify the genetic derivation
    of. these cells additional sections will be cut and reacted with various. antisera
    as follows: GFAP, LCA, EMA, CK-6, Synaptophysin and MIB-1. In addition one of
    the samples taken for electron microscopy will be. evaluated. An addendum will
    be issued when all of these are completed. COMMENT: Additional sections were cut
    from several blocks and reacted. with the following antisera: LCA, EMA, CK-6,
    and Synaptophysin; these. are negative in all the neoplastic cells. These results
    are. interpreted as confirming the initial impression that the derivation. of.
    these cells is not from lymphocytes, neuronal elements, or epithelial. cells.
    GFAP is expressed by approximately 20% of the neoplastic. cells. MIB-1: This protein
    is expressed by diverse percentages of cells in. various locations; however, the
    mean percentage of cells expressing. this protein is estimated to be about 10%.
    Sections evaluated with the electron microscope confirm the impression. that the
    cytoplasmic features as well as the nuclei of most neoplastic. cells are compatible
    with those characteristio of a neoplastic. astrocyte. A letter from Dr. is. in
    agreement with the diagnosis of anaplastic astrocytoma. The. involuntary delay
    in the issuance of this final report represents a. combination of simultaneous
    events including my absence from the. department for over two weeks, and the fact
    that the slides were. mailed. to Dr. for consultation before dictating the addendum,
    and his. reply was not opportunely delivered to the pathologist on call during.
    my absence. TISSUE COMMITTEE CODE:'

    Positive. MIB-1 proliferation index: 18%. See Microscopy Description and Comment.
    Comment. The sections contain portions of a rather cellular glial neoplastic proliferation
    that has an oligodendroglial. phenotype. The neoplastic cells are rather uniformly
    round, with a borderline mitotic rate of 3% / ten high power fields,. and an.
    elevated MIB-1 proliferation index of 18% in the more active areas. The tumor
    has focal microvascular. proliferation,. but is devoid of tumor necrosis. There
    are also zones of sparse cellularity with microcalcifications. The neoplasm is
    a cellular oligodendroglioma with 1p, 19q LOH codeletion, positive IDH1, a modest.
    mitotic rate,. positive MGMT, and a high proliferation index. The biopsy is somewhat
    small, contains tumor at the low. end of. anaplastic transformation, and is probably
    not representative of the anaplastic regions depicted on the. imaging. studies.

    POSITIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm 1p and chromosome arm 19q is. detected.
    Informative loci are: D1S1592, D1S552, D19S219, D19S412, and PLA2G4C. Results-Comments.
    Testing performed on tumor paraffin block. (A2) and a blood. specimen. to establish
    germline genotype. TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in
    Normal DNA. (baseline) / Tumor DNA pairs using 3 markers at both 1p and 19q. The
    3 markers. on 1p are D1S548, D1S1592, and D1S552 (with D1S468, D1S1612, and D1S496
    as. backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D19S412, and PLA2G4C.
    (with D19S606 and D19S1182 as backup) All markers are microsatellites (2 or. 4.
    nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat). polymorphism.
    The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score,. amplicon size, and ease
    of interpretation. The backup markers are used if the. first line markers at that
    chromosome arm are uninformative or otherwise. ambiguous in their interpretation.
    LOH at all informative loci on each. chromosomal arm represents the typical finding
    in oligodendrogliomas with 1p. and 19q deletion. FDA COMMENT: The above data are
    not to be construed as the results from a. stand-alone diagnostic test. This test
    was developed and its performance. characteristics determined by the. as. required
    by CLIA 88 regulations. It has not been cleared or approved for. specific uses
    by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) The FDA has. determined that such
    clearance or approval is not necessary. These results. are. provided for informational
    purposes only, and should be interpreted only in. the context of established procedures
    and/or diagnostic criteria. TECHNICAL SENSITIVITY: The presence of >15% non-neoplastic
    cells in the. sample. may preclude the detection of allelic loss. PRINCIPLE: Among
    the major subtypes of gliomas, oligodendrogliomas are. distinguished by their
    remarkable sensitivity to chemotherapy, with. approximately 70% of anaplastic
    (malignant) oligodendrogliomas responding. dramatically to treatment with procarbazine,
    lomustine, and vincristine. (termed PCV) (Cairncross et al, 1998). Unfortunately,
    no clinical or. pathologic feature allows accurate prediction of chemotherapeutic
    response. Oligodendrogliomas are also associated with a longer average patient
    survival. as compared to astrocytic tumors. However, the histologic distinction
    between. oligodendrogliom and astrocytoma is often highly subjective, and there
    has. been significant interobserver variation. Studies (Cairncross et al, 1998;
    Ino et al, 2001; Smith et al, 2000) have. shown that: allelic loss (loss of heterozygosity)
    of chromosome arm 1p is a. statistically significant and currently the best predictor
    of. chemosensitivity. - combined loss involving chromosome arms 1p and 19q predicts
    both. chemotherapeutic response and longer survival in patients with. oligodendrogliomas.
    - combined allelic loss of chromosomes 1p and 19q can be considered a. molecular
    signature of oligodendroglioma (present in approximately 70-80% of. oligodendroglial
    tumors and in only 10% of astrocytomas). Senior Staff Pathologist. INTRA-OPERATIVE

    that has some. "proliferation centers", and infiltrates the brain sparsely or
    moderately. There are only occasional mitotic figures, more readily observed in
    the. proliferation centers, where there is also neovascularization. There is no.
    microvascular cellular proliferation. There is no necrosis. In part C, in. addition
    to focal neoplasm, there is rarefaction and prominent reactive. astrocytosis with
    Rosenthal fibers. IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY The GFAP demonstrates absent or sparse
    gliofibrillarity. by the neoplastic cells. The tumor cells do not over express
    the p53 protein. Synaptophysin and NeuN demonstrate the proclivity of the neoplasm
    for the. cerebral cortex, and absence of positive reaction in the neoplastic cells.
    The CD34 depicts the neovascularization within the tumor. With the MIB1, the.
    overall proliferation index is about 2%, and in the proliferation centers it.
    may be up to about 4%. In the rarefied, gliotic areas of specimen C there are
    no neuronal elements,. neoplastic astrocytes, or diffuse reactivity with CD34.

    The glioma is somewhat cellular and has nuclear pleomorphism. However, there.
    are not anaplastic features, i.e. brisk mitotic activity, necrosis, or. microvascular
    cellular proliferation. The atypical cellular features. portend. a heightened
    biological potential, which in addition to the focal. enhancement. on imaging

    mutated. in up. to 40% to 50% of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant.
    III. (EGFRVIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR. that
    is. commonly expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of. glioblastoma
    "have demonstrated EGFRVIII as defining prognostically. distinct. subgroups of
    glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFRVIII has. been. shown to sensitize
    tumors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the. tumor. suppressor protein
    PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin. fixed,. paraffin embedded tissue
    samples and reverse transcribed to CDNA. The. cDNA is. then amplified using standard
    PCR technique for DNA templates. PCR. products. are detected by gel electrophoresis.
    The limit of detection of this. assay has. been determined to be approximately

    center where there is. mitotic activity. and a MIB-1 proliferation index of 6%;
    the proliferation index elsewhere is up to about 2%. There is not. endothelial.
    cell proliferation, microvascular cellular proliferation or tumor necrosis. The
    neoplasm overall is a low histological grade oligodendroglioma (WHO : 2). There
    is a proliferation. center in which. there is a moderately heightened mitotic
    and cycling activity. As an isolated finding the meaning of these. proliferation.
    centers is uncertain. They are not enough for upgrading the neoplasm; but may
    portend enhanced. biological activity,. and may perhaps be precursors of transformation.

    are: D1S548, D1S1592, D1S552, D19S1182. Results-Comments. Testing performed on
    DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block. DNA extracted from a. corresponding.
    blood specimen was used as a normal reference control. Only one of 5 loci on chromosome
    19q is informative. Based on LOH at D19S1182, LOH of 1p and. morphology of. oligodendroglioma,
    findings are consistent with deletion of 19q as well. Clinical and morphologic.
    correlation is. recommended. TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR
    assay in Normal DNA (baseline)/ Tumor DNA. pairs using 3. markers at both 1p and
    19q. The 3 markers on 1p are D1S548, D1S1592, and D1S552 (with D1S468,. D1S1612,
    and. D1S496 as backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D19S412,
    and PLA2G4C (with. D19S606 and. D19S1182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites
    (2 or 4 nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a. minisatellite (26. nt repeat) polymorphism.
    The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, amplicon size, and. ease
    of. interpretation. The backup markers are used if the first line markers at that
    chromosome arm are. uninformative or. otherwise ambiguous in their interpretation.
    LOH at all informative loci on each chromosomal arm. represents the. typical finding
    in oligodendrogliomas with 1p and 19q deletion. FDA COMMENT: The above data are
    not to be construed as the results from a stand-alone diagnostic. test. This test.

    12.5 x 8.3 x 4.6 cm. The atteched ureter measures 3.3 cm in length and. 0.4 cm
    in diameter in greatest dimension. The ureteral margin is identified and appears
    grossly uninvolved by tumor. On. opening,. the ureter is lined by a pink-ten soft
    faintly corrugated tissue. The attached renal vessels are identified, with a slight
    area. of firmness identified at the distal aspect of the smaller vessel, and the
    margins appear grossly uninvolved by tumor. The capsular. surface. is. smooth
    and pink-ten. The kidney is bivalved to reveal e pseudo encapsulated yellow-red
    tumor mass measuring 8.1 x. 7.5. X. 4.3. cm,. occupying the superior and mid poles
    of the kidney, which eppears to be partially surrounded by a rim of dense white.

    of the mass, an ill-defined firm white-ten focally hemorrhagic scarred area is
    identified measuring. 2.8. X. 2.3 cm in greatest dimension. Focal areas of necrosis
    are also identified. The mass abuts the renal celyces and serial. sectioning.
    reveals possible invasion by soft friable red-tan tumor tissue. The attached perinephric
    fat has been inked black and on. cut section reveals a focal area of possible
    extracapsular extension into the fat. The inked margins do not appear to be grossly.
    involved by tumor. Sectioning through the remainder of the kidney reveals a pink
    brown perenchyma, which appears grossly. unremarkable. The corticomedullary junction
    is well delineated, with the cortex measuring 0.6 cm in width. Sectioning through.

    nephrectomy specimen composed of a kidney, adrenal gland and perinephric adipose
    tissue, weighing 330 grams and. measuring. 13.2 x 9.8 X 3.4 cm. The external surface
    is inked black. The upper half of the kidney is replaced by an ill-defined,. vaguely,
    lobulated, variegated tumor mass, measuring 6,8 x 5.7 x 3.2 cm, located 1.1 cm
    from the adrenal gland. The tumor. extends into the renal vein from which the
    tumor grows distally as an exophytic polypoid mass, measuring 3.6 cm in length.
    The. tumor also extends into the pelvis. However, grossly ureter margin and vascular
    margins are free of tumor. The tumor appears. to extend to, but not through, the
    overlying renal capsule. On cut sections, the tumor is yellow-tan, friable tissue
    with multiple. cystic degeneration and necrosis. The remaining kidney appears
    to be unremarkable. The adrenal gland measures 4,2 x 2.0 X. 0.7 cm, and is unremarkable.

    1). The specimen is received fresh labeled "right kidney, adrenal gland and vena
    caval thrombus" and consists of a kidney with. attached ureter, renal vessels
    and perinephric fat welghing 1205 g in total. The kidney measures 18.5 x 10.6
    x 8.8 cm. The. attached ureter measures 8.1 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter.
    The attached portion of inferior vena cava measures 0.6 cm in. length and 3.9
    cm in dlameter with a protruding mass measuring 6.3 X 5.1 x 3.1 cm attached to
    the wall of inferior vena cava and. completely obliterative the renal vein. The
    portion of renal artery measures 2.7 cm long and 0.4 cm in dlameter. The renal
    artery. and ureter margins are grossly unremarkable. An adrenal gland is identified,
    measures 5.5 x 3.5 X 1.3 cm and grossly appears. unremarkable. The perinephric
    fat is of thickness ranging from 0.4 to 1.7 cm, The kidney is inked bleck and
    bivalved to reveal an. irregular soft mass with variegated appearance, measures
    12.2 x 9.8 x 8.9 cm, involving the entire upper pole and portion of the. middle
    pole of the kidney. The mass appears to involve the perinephric fat, renal sinus
    and peribilar fat and grossly extends into. the renal vessels. The pelvicaliceal
    system at the upper pole is completely compressed, while at the middle and lower
    poles, does. not appear to be involved by the mass. Two 0.5 cm in diameter renal
    calculi are noted present in the middle pole. The remainder. of. the. middle and
    lower pole shows a multiloculated cyst 2.4 cm in greatest dimension, which cannot
    be separated from the upper. pole mass as no uninvolved renal parenchyma is grossly
    identified. Sections through the remeinder of the kidney reveal a pink. brown
    paranchyma, with a well-defined cortico-medullary junction. The cortex measures
    0.6 cm. No lymph nodes are grossly. identified in the parinephric fat. Representative
    sactions are submitted for. and for permanent sections. Specimen. photographs

    is received in a single formalin-filled container labeled with the patient''s
    name,. "right upper lobe," and consists of a 15.0 x. 10.0 x 4.0 cm, lung lobe.
    The pleura is purple-gray and smooth to shaggy. A 2.0 x 2.0 cm, area of umbilication
    is present. This area is inked blue. Located on the opposite aspect of the specimen
    from the umbilication is a 6.5 x 4.0 cm area of exposed beefy red parenchyma,
    which bears multiple. exposed segments of vasculature and bronchi. The largest
    bronchus is 1.0 cm in length by 0.7 cm in diameter. The bronchial and vascular
    margins are. taken en face, and the exposed parenchyma is inked black. The bronchi
    are opened to reveal a pink-tan, striated endothelium. No discrete. endobronchial
    masses are identified. A 1.0 cm black, anthracotic nodule is identified, consistent
    with peribronchial lymph node. Extending from one edge. of the exposed parenchyma
    and involving one edge of the specimen is an 11.0 cm in length serpiginous stapled
    parenchymal margin. The staple line is. removed and the underlying parenchyma
    is inked black. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a 4.2 x 4.0 x 2.3

  - 'SICIAN INFORMATION. SURGICAL. DIAGNOSIS. DIAGNOSIS: A. Lymph node (anterior lobular),
    lymphadenectomy: Single benign anthracotic lymph node. B. Lung (right lower lobe).
    lobectomy: Poorly differentiated large cell carcinoma with squamoid features,
    3.5 cm in greatest dimension, predominantly endobronchial, but with. pulmonary
    parenchymal invasion (see comment). Closest inked pleural margin is negative for
    malignancy. Bronchus and blood vessels at surgical margin negative for malignancy;
    negative for lymphovascular invasion. Non-neoplastic pulmonary parenchyma shows
    chest wall adhesions; interstitial fibrosis, patchy. No hilar lymph nodes identified.
    C. Lymph nodes (subcarinal), lymphadenectomy: Five benign anthracotic lymph nodes.
    Adjacent soft tissue with dystrophic calcifications. D. Lymph nodes (right hilum),
    lymphadenectomy: Two benign anthracotic lymph nodes. E. Lymph nodes (right lower
    peritracheal area), lymphadenectomy: Five benign anthracotic lymph nodes. F. Lung
    (right middle lobe), wedge biopsy: Benign pulmonary parenchyma with pleural adhesions.
    COMMENTS: The endobronchial tumor in the right lower lobe (block B2) is stained
    with a battery of immunohistochemical stains to better categorize the nature of
    the. tumor. The tumor cells are strongly reactive with high molecular weight cytokeratin
    (SK) and greater than 70% of the tumor cell nuclei are positive with. p63. CD56.
    marks about 5-10% of the tumor cell cytoplasm and cytokeratin 5/6 marks approximately
    20-30% of the tumor cells. Cytokeratin 7 and thyroid. transcription. factor-1
    (TTF-1) are negative. These stains support a diagnosis of poorly differentiated
    squamous carcinoma. The mildly positive CD56. indicates a small component of a
    neuroendocrine carcinoma. The positive control slides for CK7. TTF-1, CD56, p63,
    and SK are appropriate. The. positive control for CK5/6 is assigned to case. CLINICAL

    "level 11 interlobar lymph node" are two black anthracotic 0.5 to. 0.9 cm soft
    tissue fragments. The specimen is entirely submitted in one. cassette. B) SOURCE:
    Lymph node biopsy, level 11. Labeled "level 11 lymph node" is a 1 cm partially
    anthracotic lymph node. The specimen is entirely submitted in one cassette. C)
    SOURCE: Lymph node biopsy, level 7 subcarinal. Labeled "level 7 lymph node subcarinal"
    are four fragmented partially. anthracotic lymph node fragments ranging from 0.7
    to 2 cm in greatest. dimension. The nodes are entirely submitted in four cassettes
    as follows: C1. Two nodes. C2. One node sectioned. C3-C4. Largest node sectioned.
    D) SOURCE: Lung, right lower lobe with en bloc chest wall resection. Received
    fresh labeled "right lower lobe with en bloc chest wall resection". consists of
    a right lower lobe measuring 18 X 10 X 5.8 cm with attached. ribs 8, 9, and 10
    anteriorly. The anterior soft tissue of the chest wall. resection is inked orange,
    the anterior margins of the bone green, and. posterior bone margins red. Beneath
    the ribs is a palpable lesion extending. to the pleural surface, in both the anterior
    and posterior aspects. The. pleura overlying this mass is inked black. The resection
    margin displays. tan-pink tumor at the margin but not attached to the bronchus.
    The. bronchial margin is taken en face and submitted on chuck 1 for frozen. section
    diagnosis. INTRAOPERATIVE PATHOLOGY CONSULTATION WITH FROZEN SECTION: "Bronchial.
    margin negative" is rendered by. A tan-pink 1 cm lymph node is found and is considered
    level 12 per surgeon. One additional''0.9 cm lymph node is found at the hilum.
    The tumor is. sectioned from posterior to anterior revealing a mostly well-circumscribed.
    focally necrotic tumor mass measuring 5 X 4 X 3.8 cm. The tumor appears to. attach
    to the posterior soft tissue of the intercostal muscle but does not. appear to
    invade into the bone. The tumor is 2 cm from the nearest bony. resection margin
    which is the anterior aspect of rib 9. It extends to the. pleural surface both
    anterior and posteriorly but does not extend through. it. The anterior ribs and
    soft tissue are removed and the subsequent. underlying tissue of both the ribs
    and the tumor are inked yellow. It. appears that the tumor is firmly adherent
    to rib 9 and the intercostal soft. tissue between ribs 8-9 and 9-10. The ribs
    8 and 10 appear to be detached. from the tumor. The anterior chest wall resection
    is removed from the lung. and each aspect has been inked yellow. The anterior
    and posterior bone. margins of the ribs are taken en face. Sections are taken
    of the bone at. number 9 where the tumor was attached most firmly revealing the
    tumor to. extend through the parietal pleura and does not appear to invade the.
    periosteum of the bone in rib number 9. Tumor does not appear to be within. the
    soft tissue proper of the intercostal soft tissue. There is a dense. desmoplastic
    1 cm rind focally at the tumor, rib number 9 junction. The remainder of the parenchyma
    is tan-pink and spongy with moderate. anthracosis. No additional satellite lesions
    are seen. Note that tissue is. taken for possible ancillary studies. Note: A photograph
    is taken. Representative sections are submitted in 22 cassettes labeled: 1. Frozen
    section bronchial resection margin. 2. Level 12 lymph node sectioned. 3. One additional
    hilar lymph node bisected. 4. Vascular margin. 5-9. Representative tumor to area
    of rib (yellow ink) and pleura (black. ink). 10-12. Full thickness rib number
    9 from area of tumor attachment to. anterior soft tissue margin (orange ink).

    malignancy, with extensive necrosis. Focally, convincing. squamous differentiation
    is noted. No gland formation is. appreciated. The malignancy focally extends to
    immediately. beneath the surface of the visceral pleura. Areas of. adhesion between
    visceral and parietal pleura are noted, and. some portions of parietal pleura
    are present for evaluation. These are uninvolved by the malignancy, as is the
    resected. segment of rib. The histologic appearance of localized squamous. differentiation
    corresponds to changes noted in a prior fine. needle aspiration biopsy,. No history
    of. intervening treatment is received, nowever, the focally. extensive necrosis
    in the malignancy could be the result of. intervening treatment, and clinical
    correlation is. suggested. Bronchial and vascular margins are free of. malignancy
    grossly and microscopically as are lymph nodes. There is, however, involvement
    of a bronchus at the stapled. margin by both in situ, and focally invasive, carcinoma.
    Clinical correlation is suggested. The granuloma present in one node appears inactive,
    and. special stains for microorganisms will not be performed a. this time, unless
    requested. Sections have also been reviewed by Dr. who is in. agreement. CLINICAL

    A. Sections of the mass grossly described demonstrate an invasive. malignant epithelial
    neoplasm. The tumor is composed of infiltrating. nests of somewhat polygonal cells
    with distinct cell borders with. cells containing a small to moderate amount of
    cytoplasm and enlarged. nuclei with nuclear pleomorphism. There are nests with
    central. necrosis. There are also rare neoplastic cells with dense. eosinophilic
    cytoplasm. There is no definite lymphovascular. invasion. The tumor is seen closely
    approaching, but not involving,. the pleural surface. Focal vague lumina differentiation
    is noted. Immunohistochemistry stains are obtained and the neoplastic cells are.
    positive with cytokeratin 5, positive with cytokeratin 7, negative. with cytokeratin
    20, negative staining with TTF-1, strong nuclear. staining with p63, and negative
    staining of the tumor cells with. Napsin-A. The remainder of the lung demonstrates
    mild interstitial. fibrosis with mildly thickened alveolar septae. B. Multiple
    sections are examined and sections of the bronchial surgical. margins are free
    of tumor. The vascular margins are also free of. tumor. No peribronchial lymph
    node is identified. Sections of the. lung at the previous wedge resection site
    demonstrates hemorrhage. with no residual tumor. Random sections of the lung demonstrate
    mild. fibrosis and bronchiectasis. Sections demonstrate fragments of a benign

    along the anterior surface and toward the basilar portion. The lateral apical.
    portion of the lobe has a mottled yellow-tan to pink to reddish violet appearance
    with thickening of the. pleura over an area measuring 7.5x 5 cm, The bronchial
    margin is identified and is removed as a thin. shave for en face trozen section.
    On dissection there is an apical tumor mass which is composed of tan to. pale
    yellow to pale red fissue and overall measures 5.5 x 5.2 x 4 cm. This tumor is
    centrally cavitary. containing blood clot. This lesion is grossly 0.5 cm from
    the bronchial margin and abuts the pleural. surface in numerous areas. The inferior
    edge of the lung has a ratty irregular appearance. An intralobar. fissure is not
    appreciated grossly. This tumor mass is 2 cm from the closest inferior edge. The
    remaining. lung has a wet soggy consolidated appearance. Representative sections
    are submitted. Section summary: A1) bronchial margin from frozen section, A2)

    Description: A. Sections of the lobectomy show an invasive squamous cell carcinoma
    predominantly forming. angulated and irregular nests with enlarged nuclei and
    occasional prominent nucleoli. There is mild. keratin formation with intercellular
    bridges and punctate necrosis. The tumor is away from the bronchial. and vascular
    margin but does invade through the visceral pleura where there is dense fibrosis,
    Tumor is at. the inked outer margin. No diagnostic lymphovascular or perineural
    invasion is identified, The uninvolved. lung has minimal changes. The rounded
    focus at the bronchial margin on the frozen section stide is a. rounded aggregate
    of degenerate hyaline cartilage that has some squamoid features,. B. Sections
    of the additional bronchial margin show benign bronchus and surrounding lung tissue.
    uninvolved by malignancy. C. Sections of the pulmonary ligament N9L specimen show
    a distorted fragment of lung tissue with a. nested well differentiated neoplastic
    process at one edge measuring 0.9 cm. The cells are uniformly small. with oval
    nuclei and even lightly speckled chromatin, No necrosis or mitotic activity is
    present. The lesion. is at the distorted edge of the lissue. Immunohistochemistry
    shows the lesion is positive for chromogranin. and synaptophysin. The tumor is
    negative for pancytokeratin. D. Sections of the hilar N10L lymph node show a single
    benign lymph node (0/1) with focal fibrosis. No. malignancy is identified. E.
    Sections of the subcarinal N7 lymph node show a single benign lymph node (0/1).

    lobe (frozen). Initially received in the fresh state for frozen section analysis
    and. tumor bank studies is a 227 gram lobe of lung, 14.5 X 11.7 X 4.2 cm. The
    bronchial margin extends out to. 0.6 cm and the margins are initially, grossly
    free of tumor involvement. The pleura is glistening, light tan. to congested,
    deep purple-red, with mild anthracotic pigmentation. A palpable mass near the
    bronchial. stump creates a slightly raised, tense, glistening appearance. The
    bronchial margin is trimmed, along with. two adjacent lymph node candidates, and
    submitted for frozen section analysis, with the residual frozen. tissue submitted
    for permanent sections, Following closer examination, a bronchial tract is partially.
    obstructed by a protruding tumor mass. The involved bronchial tract is incised,
    to reveal the obstructing. tumor mass penetrating through the wall, within 0.7
    cm of the formal bronchial surgical margin. The. well-circumscribed, rubbery,
    light pink-gray tumor mass is centrally necrotic, and is 3.3 X 3.2 X 2.8 cm. The.
    tumor is placed within 0.2 cm of the anterior-medial pleura. Representative portions
    of tumor and. adjacent lung parenchyma are submitted for tumor bank studies. Sectioning
    along several of these lobar. and segmental ducts, reveals pathways occluded by
    tenacious and purulent mucin. The inferior periphery. demonstrates a dense yellow-gray
    nodule up to 0.7 X 0.7 X 0.6 cm, grossly consistent with a granuloma. (G8). The
    remaining cut sections of the lung demonstrates congested, spongy to predominantly.
    consolidated lung parenchyma with gross severe fibrotic change along the inferior-anterior

    \ cm and 290 grams. There. are multiple linear staple lines in the hilar area\
    \ and one at the. apex. Bronchial resection margin is taken for frozen section.\
    \ examination (FSA1). Vessel resection margins in this area are submitted in block\
    \ 4. Two. centimeters from the bronchial resection margin, there is a 3.1 x. 2.-\
    \ x 1.5 cm firm tan, partially necrotic tumor mass of the. anteromedial segment,\
    \ which encases and apparently obstructs the. bronchus, as distal bronchi exude\
    \ white pus-like material. A tumor. appears to extend up to the large vessel wall,\
    \ which is not. occluded, and to involve adjacent peribronchial lymph node (blocks.\
    \ 5-7) . Overlying pleura in this area is not grossly involved, but. ragged and\
    \ with staple lines impeding evaluation (block 8). Three. black peribronchial\
    \ lymph nodes contiguous with the mass appear. partially involved by tumor and\
    \ range from 0.6 to 1.2 cm in greatest. dimension each (block 9-11, one node each)\
    \ . A separate firm tan tumor mass involving the apex of the superior. segment,\
    \ is 3.5 cm away from the bronchial resection margin and 2.5. cm from the hilar\
    \ tumor. It is ovoid, 4.2 x 2 x 2.6 cm, firm,. tan-white and with elevated, well-defined\
    \ margins. The tumor. appears to involve disrupted parenchyma beneath the suture\

    \ SECTION DIAGNOSIS. A1. Right lower lobectomy. Bronchial resection margin, negative\
    \ for carcinoma. Tumor 2. cm from bronchial resection margin. Diagnosis to Dr.\
    \ A2. Parenchymal margin of apex tumor: Positive for carcinoma. B. Right middle\
    \ lobectomy: Bronchial resection margin, negative for carcinoma. MICROSCOPIC.\
    \ A. The frozen section control block confirms the frozen section. findings of\
    \ a negative bronchial resection margin. The frozen. section control of the apex\
    \ tumor confirms that is a nonsmall cell. carcinoma of high grade with foci of\
    \ necrosis and apparent extensive. invasion of vascular channels, probably lymphatics.\
    \ As noted grossly the large vein near the hilum and has infiltrating. carcinoma\
    \ in its wall and the associated artery is negative. The. lymph node that is grossly\
    \ involved near the hilum contains. metastatic high-grade carcinoma. The tumor\
    \ focally has squamous. features and I do not see any small cell carcinoma, but\
    \ part of the. larger tumor by the hilum does have some smaller cell size, but.\
    \ appears to be a less mature form of squamous cell carcinoma. The. tumor in blocks\
    \ 12 and 13 from the apex has larger cells and more. glassy cytoplasm and on H\
    \ and E a question of additional. adenocarcinoma is raised. Out of all sampled\
    \ lymph nodes we have four of six positive lymph. nodes. The tumor grows immediately\
    \ beneath the pleural surface, but. does not present to the outer surface. Focal\
    \ invasion into the. pleura is noted. Due to the multiple histologic morphologic\
    \ variations in the tumors,. selected blocks A7 and A13 from the hilar and apical\
    \ foci are. selected, respectively, for additional immunostains. P63 and CK 5,.\
    \ squamous markers, are strongly positive in both tumor nodules. TTF-1, a good\
    \ marker for adenocarcinomas and small cell carcinoma is. negative except for\
    \ a few scattered cells. The stains were prepared. at. and the controls work.\
    \ These results indicate. squamous cell carc\xEDnoma throughout both tumor nodules.\
    \ B. The frozen section control confirms the frozen section findings. of a bronchial\
    \ resection margin negative for tumor. Additional. tissue from this specimen is\
    \ processed and all is negative for. invasive tumor. C. The lymph node is negative\
    \ for tumor. D. The lymph node is reactive but is negative for metastatic. tumor.\
    \ E. The lymph node is enlarged but is reactive, negative for. metastatic disease.\
    \ DIAGNOSIS. A. Right middle lung lobe, resection with frozen sections: Two foci\
    \ of squamous cell carcinoma, poorly differentiated. Hilar tumor 3.1 cm in diameter.\
    \ Apical tumor 4.2 cm in diameter. Metastatic squamous cell carinoma in four of\

    the EGFR. SpectrumOrang and the CEP7 SpectrumGreen probes. ALK FISH analysis was
    manually performed and quantitatively assessed by analysis of a minimum of 60
    cells using the ALK. SpectrumOrange (telomeric) and the ALK SpectrumGreen (centromeric)
    probes. UCCC criteria for stratification of NSCLC patients: EGFR FISH positive:
    1) EGFR gene amplification defined as one of the following: a) EGFR gene to CEP7
    ratio > 2. b) Small gene cluster (4-10 copies) or innumerable tight gene cluster''in
    > 10% of tumor cells. c) Larger and brighter EGFR signals than CEP7 signals in

    the adjacent stromal and reactive cells. d) 7 15 copies of the EGFR signals in
    > 10% of tumor cells or. 2) Specimens with > 40% of cells displaying A 4 copies
    of the EGFR signal. EGFR FISH negative: Specimens without gene amplification as
    defined above and with 40% of cells displaying > 4 copies of the EGFR signal.
    Clinical studies show high EGFR gene copy number by FISH analysis to be associated
    with favorable clinical benefit (clinical. response, stable disease, time to progression,
    and survival) in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with.
    EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. ALK translocation is detected as follows: ALK
    negative: 0-15% of cells positive for the ALK rearrangement. Normal cells without
    the ALK translocation show green and orange signals in juxtaposition. ALK positive:
    Greater than 15% of cells positive for the ALK rearrangement. Cells. with. the
    ALK translocation show one of the following patterns: One pair of signals (green
    and orange) fused or in juxtaposition. and one green and one orange signal separated;
    Only split o & G (single O. and single G in the same nucleus); Only single O;.
    Fusion + single O. Addendum. The granulomas in the left lower lobe lung specimen
    (Part 7) and left lower lobe bronchial lymph node (Part 9) show small fungal.
    yeast forms on the Grocott stain that are negative on the mucicarmine stains.
    These fungal forms most likely represent. Histoplasma species. Clinical correlation

    STATEMENT. The patient is an. man with a 2.4 cm moderately differentiated invasive
    squamous cell carcinoma of. the left upper lobe. vascular and bronchial margins
    are free and the tumor involves the visceral but not the. parietal pleura. Hilar
    lymph nodes, lymph node near lingular artery, left upper lobe segmental lymph
    node and. left level 5 lymph node are all negative for tumor. Angiolymphatic invasion
    is seen. There is a mild host. lymphocytic response. The TNM staging is T2N0MX,
    stage 1B. The non-neoplastic lung shows. emphysematous changes. PART 1: LYMPH

    lymph node". Received in saline is a single anthracotic irregular. piece of tissue
    measuring 1.2 x 0.9 x 0.3 cm. Submitted entirely in a cassette labeled 2A. Part
    3 is labeled "left level 5 lymph node in blood stained fluid". It consists of
    a single piece of tissue. measuring 6.0 X 0.6 x 0,2 cm. Submitted entirely in
    a cassette labeled 3A,. Part 4 is labeled "left upper lobe". It consists of a
    grayish-pink, anthracotic lobe of lung measuring 15.0 X 11.0 X. 0.9 cm. There
    is puckering of the pleural surface corresponding to which there is a firm mass
    on palpation. The bronchial (stapled) and vascular margin is identified. There
    is no additional parenchyma stapled margin. The specimen is inked and serially
    sectioned and shows a grayish white tumor measuring 2.4 X 2.1 x 0.4 cm. The tumor
    seems to be close to the pleural surface but does not extend up to the pleural
    surface grossly. The. lung parenchyma appears normal. Sections are submitted as
    follows: 4A - hilar lymph nodes. 4B - vascular margin. 4C - bronchial margin.

    1: Immunostaining for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEAN) is performed on sections.
    from Block A1 ("right ovary") and G1 ("omentum"). The immunostaining is done.
    using DAKO rabbit anti--human CEA which is "the purified immunoglobulin. fraction
    of rabbit antiserum (DAKO product A115) The histological sections of. ovary contains
    abundant adenocarcinoma for evaluation. The tumor cells stain. focally for carcinoembryonic
    antigen. The cells that stain positively are. scattered throughout the tumor,
    and I estimate that the positively staining. cells comprise only 1 to 2% of the
    population. The positively staining cells. exhibit mildly intense staining. There
    are focal areas within the tumor where. there is a greater percentage of cells
    which stain positively (approximately. 1/3 of the tumor cells are positive), but
    this is compensated for by other. areas in which none of the tumor cells stain
    positively. Overall, there is. insignificant expression of CEA by the tumor. The
    histological sections from the omentum also contain abundant tumor. There. is
    no significant staining of the tumor cells for carcinoembryonic antigen. I certify
    that I personally conducted the diagnostic evaluation of the above. specimen (s)

    NOTE: The origin of the tumor, a serous adenocarcinoma, is most likely of. ovarian
    origin, although there is some. degree of uncertainty. Key features. are (1) large
    size of the ovarian tumor and (2) WT-1 reactivity which is. usually positive in
    ovarian serous primaries, but usually negative in. endometrial serous primaries.
    While there was a past history of endometrial. tumor detected by pap smear, it
    is possible this is from cells shed by the. ovarian tumor that have passed through
    the reproductive canal. The tumor also. occupies half of the endometrial polyp,
    including its interior, which is not. typical for a metastasis, but certainly
    can be expected if present for some. period of time, The polyp arises in the lower
    uterine segment and has. prolapsed into the cervix. I certify that I personally

    1: This addendum is issued to report the results for immunostaining for HER2/neu.
    oncoprotein. The test is performed at the request of. Immunostaining for HER2/neu
    (c-erbB-2) oncoprotein is performed on recut. sections of block A2 ("left ovary")
    . The immunostaining is done using DAKO. rabbit anti-human c-erbB-2 oncoprotein
    which is an affinity-isolated antibody. (DAKO product number A0485) The immunostaining
    is performed after antigen. retrieval by heating the unstained sections at 95
    degrees centigrade for 20. minutes in 10 mM citrate buffer, pH 6.0 The primary
    antibody is used at a. dilution of 1:1500 (manual staining) or 1:2000 (autostainer),
    with an. incubation for one hour at 37 degrees centigrade. The Histostain Plus
    kit. (Zymed Laboratories) is used as the detection system. The histological. section
    consists predominantly of serous adenocarcinoma with areas of. papillary differentiation.
    The tumor has a variable immunostaining profile. The majority of the tumor has
    negligible staining of the cytoplasm or cell. membrane (score = 0) . There is
    a minority population of the tumor cells that. u1. has trace staining of the cytoplasm
    with mildly to moderately intense. circumferential staining of the cell membrane.
    These cells with. circumferential cell membrane staining are present as multiple
    foci scattered. throughout the tumor. This makes it difficult to estimate the
    overall tumor. population with the staining pattern indicative of weak overexpression
    of. HER2/neu oncoprotein, but I estimate that such cells account for approximately.
    5% of the tumor cells. In summary, the serous adenocarcinoma present in the left
    ovary has a. subpopulation of tumor cells (approximately 5% of the total population)
    with. an immunostaining profile indicative of mild overexpression of HER2/neu.
    oncoprotein. I certify that I personally conducted the diagnostic evaluation of
    the above. specimen (s) and have rendered the above diagnosis (es).'

  - 'GROSS EXAMINATION: The specimen is received in seven separate containers. A.
    "Omental cake", received fresh. There are two large masses of tumor which. in
    aggregate weigh approximately 98.9 grams. The external surface of the tumor. is
    firm and yellow and varies in consistency to smooth to rough. Throughout. both
    tumor nodules the consistency and color is homogenous, Upon slicing. there is
    a gritty and mucinous character to the masses. Block Summary: A1-representative
    section of larger tumor mass. A2-representative section of smaller tumor mass.
    B. "Cecum tumor nodules", fresh. Received fresh is a firm, nodular piece of. fibroadipose
    tissue measuring 3 cm x 1 cm x 1 cm. Upon slicing this tissue. a. firm nodule
    of tumor entirely consistent with the tumor described in Block A. is. identified.
    Representative section is submitted in. C. "Right ovary and tube". Received is
    a large structure which measures 66.9. grams and measures 6 x 3 x 3 cm. A large
    cyst is present on the structure. which has been opened prior to receipt in the
    pathology laboratory. The large. multiloculated mass is identified within the
    cyst cavity which varies in color. from white to light yellow and is firm and
    fleshy throughout. The residual. mucoid material from the cyst is present. No
    residual ovary or fallopian tube. is identified within the large mass replacing
    the ovary. Block Summary: C1- representative sections through thin area of cyst
    wall. C2- section through tumor and cyst wall. C3- sections through thicker nodular
    portion of cyst wall. C4- representative sections of tumor nodule. C5- additional
    section of tumor nodule. D. "Portion left ovary". Fresh. Received fresh are two
    large portions of. yellowish mucinous tumor. The largest pieces measures 5 x 4
    x 4 cm, the. smaller piece 7 x 3 x 2 cm. In aggregate the two specimen weigh approximately.
    69 grams. No identifiable ovary is present. Sectioning of both masses reveal.
    a homogenous white to yellow gritty mass which exudes mucinous material upon.
    cutting. Representative sections are submitted in. E. "Uterus and left ovary",
    fresh. Received is a small portion of uterus. measuring 3.5 x 4 x 2 cm and large
    cystic structure which replaces the left. ovary which measures approximately 6
    x 4 x 4 cm. The cervix is not. identified. The uterus body is soft. The serosal
    surface of the uterus does. not appear to contain any grossly identifiable nodules
    of the tumor. However,. the serosal surface is very roughened and hemorrhagic.
    The large cystic mass. replacing the left ovary is similar in appearance to the
    previously described. nodules of tumor. The fallopian tube is difficult to identify
    secondary to. the tumor burden. Block Summary: E1, E2- representative sections
    through uterus. E3- multiple fallopian tube candidates. E4- sections through tumor
    in area suspicious for residual ovary. E5- additional section of tumor. F. "Tumor
    on recto-sigmoid": Received are six fragments of hemorrhagic tumor. which in aggregate
    measure approximately 4.5 x 4 x 2 cm. Representative. sections are submitted in
    Blocks F1 and F2. G. "Fibroid". The nodule weighs approximately 50 grams. Received
    is a large. spheroid shape nodule which measures 4.5 x 4 x 2 cm. Palpation of
    this nodule. reveals firm areas within the capsule of the nodule. There is cautery
    along. the soft tissue margin of this nodule. Longitudinal sectioning of the nodule.
    reveals a large mostly necrotic mass of white to yellow gritty tissue. consistent
    with tumor described in previous areas. The central core of the. nodule appears
    somewhat more viable than the remainder. Representative. sections are submitted
    in Blocks G1 and G2_. DIAGNOSIS: OVARIES, BILATERAL (C,D,E) : SEROUS ADENOCARCINOMA,
    FIGO GRADE 2, WITH MASSIVE. PSAMMOMA COMPONENT (PSAMMOMOCARCINOMA), WITH MASSIVE
    METASTASES INVOLVING. OMENTUM (A), CECUM (B), RIGHT FALLOPIAN TUBE (C), UTERUS
    (E), LEFT FALLOPIAN. TUBE (E), RECTOSIGMOID REGION (F). SUBMITTED AS UTERINE FIBROID
    (G) : THE ENTIRE SPECIMEN CONSISTS OF METASTATIC. SEROUS ADENOCARCINOMA. ENDOMETRIUM
    (E) : A SMALL FRAGMENT OF TUMOR IS PRESENT IN THE ATROPHIC. ENDOMETRIUM. WHILE
    PART IS HIGHLY CILIATED, RAISING THE POSSIBILITY OF A. SEPARATE PRIMARY, MUCH
    RESEMBLES THE TUMOR IN THE OVARY, FOR WHICH REASON THE. ENDOMETRIAL TUMOR IS CONSIDERED
    TO BE IMPLANTATION. ADDENDUM 1: Immunostaining for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)
    is performed on sections. from Block A1 ("omental cake") and D1 ("portion left
    ovary") The. immunostaining is done using DAKO rabbit anti-human CEA which is
    "the purified. immunoglobulin fraction of rabbit antiserum". . The. section from
    Block A1 contains abundant adenocarcinoma with numerous psammoma. bodies. There
    is very heterogeneous staining for CEA. There are foci of. tumor in which all
    of the cells stain for CEA. Approximately 3/4 of these. cells have moderately
    intense staining and 1/4 have markedly intense. staining. These foci where all
    of the tumor cells stain comprise only a small. portion of the tumor. The more
    common pattern of staining is where there are. mixtures of positively staining
    and negatively staining cells adjacent to each. other. In these areas, approximately
    2/3 of the tumor cells stain. positively. The staining intensity is evenly distributed
    between mildly. intense and markedly intense in these areas. Though there is great.
    variability in staining for CEA from one region of the tumor to the other, I.
    estimate that approximately 50% of the tumor cells exhibit some degree of. staining
    for CEA. The histological sections of the left ovary also contain abundant tumor
    for. evaluation. As with the metastasis to the omentum, the primary tumor exhibits.
    marked heterogeneity in staining for CEA. There is one area of the tumor. where
    there is necrotic debris and neutrophils between clusters of cancer. cells. The
    debris and neutrophils stain positively which is a common. cross-reaction with
    this antibody. There is more abundant staining of the. tumor than was noted in
    the metastasis. There are many areas in which there. are positively staining cells
    adjacent to negatively staining cells. There. are also areas of the tumor in which
    many positively stained cells are. adjacent to each other. The intensity of the
    tumor cell staining varies. widely, as was noted in the metastasis. Approximately
    40% of the positively. staining cells exhibit markedly intense staining, 40% exhibit
    moderately. intense staining and 20% exhibit mildly intense staining. Overall,
    I estimate. that approximately 50% of the tumor cells exhibit expression of. carcinoembryonic
    antigen. I certify that I personally conducted the diagnostic evaluation of the
    above. specimen (s) and have rendered the above diagnosis (es).'

    show preservation of the normal. architecture with focal microscopic surface implants
    of. adenocarcinoma. The tumor focally contains prominent numbers. of. psammoma
    bodies. Identical surface implants of adenocarcinoma are. present on the left
    and right fallopian tubes, and on the serosal. surfaces of the uterus, cervix,
    and appendix. The omentum is also. diffusely involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma.
    There is no. evidence of a primary malignancy in the ovary, fallopian tubes,.
    endometrium, or cervix. The findings of multifocal microscopic tumor implants
    largely. limited to the surfaces of the left ovary and fallopian tubes is. F.
    highly suggestive of metastatic involvement of these structures. A. similar pattern
    of multifocal surface involvement was seen in this. patient''s prior right oophorectomy

    Signed Out By. Intraoperative Consultation: An intraoperative non-microscopic
    consultation was obtained. and interpreted as: "called to the O.R. to pickup ''left

    Microscopic Description and Comment: Histologic sections of the invasive. adenocarcinoma
    in both the right and left ovaries show predominantly a papillary serous. pattern.
    In several foci, the papillae are fused so that solid sheets of cells are seen.
    In. one focus in the left ovary, the tumor is composed of sheets of cells with
    variably cleared. cytoplasm. These latter elements also focally exhibit spindled
    features; nonetheless, we. regard them as most consistent with a minor clear cell
    component. Other foci of the tumor. exhibit mucinous features with irregular nests,
    glands and clusters of neoplastic mucinous. epithelial cells resting in mucin
    pools. In many of the metastatic foci, including the. gastrocolic omentum, the
    rectosigmoid nodule, the bladder serosa, and in both fallopian. tubes, this latter
    component is conspicuous. Irrespective of the histologic pattern that. predominates
    in any given location, psammomatous calcification in invariably present. Tumor.
    is also present on the posterior serosal surface of the uterus and in the posterior
    uterine. peritoneal reflection. It is possible that this tumor may have arisen
    in an extra-mullerian. site; however, despite the unusual mucinous elements in
    this tumor, we believe that this. process is best interpreted as a primary ovarian
    papillary serous carcinoma with multifocal. intraabdominal spread and lymph nodal
    metastasis. Recognition of the mucinous elements in. this case is important, because
    of the likelihood that subsequent metastases with contain. or be dominated by.
    this pattern of disease. has reviewed this case and. agrees with this interpretation.

    consistent with Mullerian. origin, by. Microscopic Description and Comment: Poorly
    differentiated. adenocarcinoma of mixed epithelial type, with endometrioid and
    serous differentiation, is. present in multiple locations. The bulk of the tumor
    is in the omentum which is diffusely. replaced, but large tumor implants are also
    present on the uterine serosa and on the. surfaces only of both ovaries. One fallopian
    tube is distended by a 1.5 cm nodule of tumor. in the lumen. Poorly differentiated
    adenocarcinoma is present in the peritubal soft tissue. of the other fallopian
    tube. Because of the history of endometrial adenocarcinoma in a. recent endometrial
    biopsy performed at an outside institution, the entire endometrium. has been submitted
    for histologic evaluation. Very focal microscopic foci of moderately. differentiated
    adenocarcinoma of endometrioid type are present. There is no associated. myometrial
    or lymphvascular space invasion. Sections of lower uterine segment and cervix
    are. free of carcinoma. Several small leiomyomas are identified within myometrium,
    the largest. measuring 1.5 cm. When tumor is present in multiple locations in
    the female genital tract it is difficult. to determine whether tumor in one location
    is metastatic from another site or whether. they represent synchronous primary
    tumors. Because the bulk of the tumor in this case. is peritoneal, and the tumor
    in the endometrium is microscopic and not associated with. myometrial or lymphvascular
    space invasion, I favor that these represent synchronous primary. peritoneal and
    endometrial carcinomas or that the endometrial carcinoma is metastatic from. the

    There is a smaller piece of tissue also present containing tissue suspicious.
    for tumor. No orientation of the smaller specimens is possible. Labeled C1 - section
    of. subserosal nodule, and sections of firm tissue suspicious for tumor. Jar 1.
    The fourth container is labeled "L ovary.'' It contains three pieces of irregularly-shaped.
    tissue, which is not grossly identifiable as tube or ovary. The largest piece
    is 4.5 x. 3.0 x 1.5 cm, and has firm, pink-tan tissue, grossly suspicious for
    tumor. A small amount. of adipose tissue is present on the specimen, as well.
    The surfaces are regular, with. a papillary gross appearance. One of the smaller
    pieces contains tissue which possible. represents residual ovary. No fallopian
    tube is identified. Labeled D1, D2 - sections of. tumor; D3. - possible residual
    ovary. Jar 1. The fifth container is labeled "appendix." It contains a 5 x 1.5
    x 1.5 cm vermiform. appendix, with a dark red, tan surface suspicious for tumor.
    Serial cuts through the. appendix reveal an intact appendiceal lumen, with a mass
    of firm, gray-tan tumor in the. adventitia, and focally involving the muscularis
    of the appendix. Labeled E1 - tumor in. adventitia and muscle; E2 - normal-appearing
    appendix. Jar 1. The sixth container is labeled "small bowel. It contains an 18
    cm in length x 2.0. cm in diameter segment of bowel. The serosa of the bowel is
    dark brown, and possibly. ischemic appearing. The bowel is opened to show green-to-brown
    mucosa, with an area of. possible ischemia measuring approximately 7 cm in length,
    6 cm from one of the stapled. ends. In addition, there is an area of constriction.
    Within the mesentery, several areas. are suspicious for involvement by tumor,
    with the largest measuring 1.0 cm in greatest. dimension. Labeled F1 - one staple
    margin; F2 - other staple margin; F3 - two sections from. possible ischemic region;
    F4 - possible tumor implants. Jar 3. The seventh container is labeled "porta hepatis
    mass, It contains several fragments of. tissue, the largest representing a tumor
    mass measuring 3.6 x 2.5 x 1.7 cm. The tissue. consists entirely of tan, slightly
    papillary tissue, with an occasional cyst on the surface. On cut section, a solid,
    tan-white tumor mass is present, with central necrosis. Two. sections labeled
    G1. The remaining pieces of tissue have a similar appearance to the larger. piece
    of tissue. Jar 1. The eighth container is labeled "R external iliac In." It contains
    a 5.0 x 4.0 x 1.0 cm. aggregate of fat, and five possible lymph nodes. The largest

    biopsy. "Poorly differentiated carcinoma with papillary features, ". FS2 : Upper
    abdominal mass. "Pancreatic tissue with pseudocyst, ". Microscopic Description
    and Comment: The bulk of the tumor in this case is present in the omentum which
    is largely replaced by. papillary serous adenocarcinoma. The sigmoid mesentery
    also contains a small amount of. papillary serous adenocarcinoma. The ovaries
    and endometrium have been entirely submitted. for histologic evaluation. A small
    amount of papillary serous adenocarcinoma is present on. the left ovary (2 mm)
    and in left paraovarian soft tissue. Sections of both fallopian tubes. show numerous,
    small, detached fragments of adenocarcinoma in the lumens but no invasive. carcinoma
    is present in either tube. A single, small focus of in situ adenocarcinoma. is
    present in the right fallopian tube. Sections of endometrium show a single focus
    of. endometrial intraepithelial carcinoma involving a single gland (slide E14)
    No invasive. serous carcinoma was present in the endometrium. The pancreatic biopsy
    shows a pseudocyst. with surrounding chronic pancreatitis and a small amount of
    islet cell hyperplasia. No. pancreatic carcinoma is identified. In summary, I
    believe this case is best classified as primary peritoneal papillary serous. carcinoma
    with small foci of in-situ serous carcinoma involving the fallopian tube and.
    endometrium. Others have raised the possibility that even non-invasive serous
    carcinoma in. the endometrium may be the source of extrauterine spread. Reference:

    is based upon my. personal examination of the slides (and/or other material indicated
    in the diagnosis). Microscopic Description and Comment: Poorly differentiated
    papillary serous adenocarcinoma. extensively replaces the omentum, is present
    on the serosal surfaces of the appendix,. uterus, both ovaries and both fallopian
    tubes and involves the specimens labelled "colonic. implant" and "small bowel
    implant. Both ovaries have been entirely submitted and no. significant cortical
    involvement is identified. The endometrium exhibits cystic atrophy but. is free
    of carcinoma. The myometrium contains several leiomyomas, the largest measuring
    0.3. cm. Because the bulk of the tumor is present in the omentum and peritoneal
    locations and the. totally submitted ovaries exhibit only a a small amount of
    tumor on the serosal surfaces,. this tumor is best classified as a primary peritoneal
    papillary serous adenocarcinoma. History: The patient is a. with a history of
    breast carcinoma. now has malignant ascites and a pelvic mass. Operative procedure:
    Examination under. anesthesia, exploratory laparotomy, omentectomy, appendectomy,
    total abdominal hysterectomy,. bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and tumor debulking.

    The specimens are received in five containers of formalin, each labeled. with
    the patient''s name. The first container is additionally labeled "omentum. It.
    consists of a 40 x 15 x 5 cm omental cake extensively involved by a solid, tan-yellow
    tumor. mass. Labeled A1 - A3. The second container is labeled "bladder flap. It
    consists of irregular grey-tan,. tumor-like tissue measuring 3.5 x 2.5 x 2 cm
    in aggregate. The third container is labeled "cul-de-sac tumor. " It consists
    of a 2.5 x 1 x 0.8 cm. grey-tan nodule, compatible with tumor. The fourth container
    is labeled "uterus, cervix, BSO. It consists of a 92 gram, 7.5 x. 4 x 3 cm uterus
    with attached bilateral adnexae. The serosa of the uterus, except for the. presence
    of a subserosal leiomyoma, is smooth and unremarkable. The ectocervix measures.
    3.5 cm in greatest diameter and is covered by a grey-tan, slightly hemorrhagic
    mucosa. The endocervix is 2.5 cm in length and has a slightly mucoid, yellow,
    mucosa that is free. of tumor. The endometrial cavity measures 2.5 x 1.5 cm and
    has an unremarkable tan-yellow. mucosa. The myometrium is composed of a coarsely
    trabeculated musculature, that, except for. the presence of a circumscribed, white,
    whorled, 7 mm leiomyoma is grossly unremarkable. The right ovary has previously
    been opened. It measures approximately 3 x 2 x 2 cm and. is apparently largely
    replaced by a unilocular cyst. The cyst contains a single solid. tan-yellow papillary
    area measuring 1.0 cm in greatest dimension and covering less than. 10% of the
    total cyst surface area. The remaining surface area is smooth, glistening and.
    unremarkable. The right fallopian tube measures 4.5 cm in length and has fimbria
    at the. distal end. There are three small tumor nodules in the paratubal soft
    tissues that measure. up to 8 mm in greatest dimension. The tube, appears grossly
    free of tumor. The left adnexal. structures are ill-defined grossly, due to the
    presence of numerous hemorrhagic adhesions. There appears to be a portion of ovary
    that measures 2 x 1 x 0.4 cm. There are nodular. excrescences on the surface but
    these appear to represent hemorrhagic exudate. Sectioning of. the ovary shows
    a normal-appearing grey-white stroma, without gross evidence of tumor. There.
    is also a distorted portion of fallopian tube that has fimbria distally and appears
    grossly. uninvolved by tumor. Labeled D1, anterior cervix; D2, anterior endomyometrium;
    D3, posterior. cervix; D4, posterior endomyometrium; D5, subserosal leiomyoma;
    D6 - D12, completely. embedded right adnexal tissue; D13 - D20 completely embedded
    left adnexal tissues. The fifth container is labeled "umbilical nodule. It consists
    of an irregular 3 x 3 x 2 cm. fragment of fibrosis tisue. The sectioned tissue
    shows specimen replacement of the adipose. tissue by tumor. Synopsis SYNOPTIC

    within. a. fibroblastic stroma. Lymphatic invasion is identified. The. tumor shows
    a predominant papillary architecture with scattered. solid proliferations, and
    is characterized by large polygonal. cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm
    and enlarged. pleomorphic nuclei with prominent nucleoli. Scattered markedly.
    COMMENT (continued). enlarged nuclei and multinucleated forms are present, and
    atypical. mitoses are easily identified. The largest nodule of tumor. measures
    3.5 cm in greatest dimension. Both the right and left ovaries show ma 1 nodulos
    of papillary. serous adenocarcinoma that predominantly involves the ovarian. surfaces.
    The largest nodule in the ovary measues 0. 7 cm in. greatest dimension. The ovaries
    otherwise contain numerous benign. cysts lined by serous or flattened cuboidal
    epithelium. Serosal. involvement of both fallopian tubes are present. The hysterectomy
    specimen shows patchy serosal involvement by. serous papillary carcinoma and foci
    of intralymphatic tumor in the. cervix. Benign endocervial polyps, a 1 cm endometrial
    polyp, and. a 1.5 cm submucosal leiomyoma and multiple intramural leiomyomata.
    are also noted. In summary, although both ovaries are involved by serous papillary.
    adenocarcinoma, the ovaries are not markedly enlarged, and show. predominantly
    surface involvement. The bulk of the tumor appears. to involve the pelvis and
    peritoneum, and raises the possibility. of a primary peritoneal origin of the
    tumor with metastatic. involvement of the ovaries. There is no evidence of metastatic.

    two firm pieces of soft tissue, one of which is brown-black, measuring 3 x 0.9.
    x 0.3 cm in greatest dimension; the other is tan-yellow-and-brown, measuring 3,7
    x 1 x 0.5 cm in greatest dimension. The second container is labeled. It contains
    a uterus and cervix, and two detached fallopian. tubes and ovaries. The uterus
    and cervix measure 6 cm from comu-to-comu, 10 cm from cervix-to-fundus, and 6.2
    cm. from anterior-to-posterior. Approximately 25% of the cervix has been previously
    removed from the anterior half. The. uterus is opened to show a flattened endometrial
    polyp within a triangular endometrial cavity. The endometrial polyp. measures
    2.2. x 1.5 cm. The endometrial cavity measures 3 x 3. The endocervical canal is
    unremarkable and. measures 2.5 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter. The remaining
    cervix and ectocervix are tan-white and. unremarkable. A single intramuscular
    fibroid, with a tan-white and whorled cut surface, is identified and measures
    1. cm in greatest dimension. There are two ovaries with attached fallopian tubes
    also identified within the container. The. smaller of the two has a fallopian
    tube with a paratubal cyst; the fallopian tube measures 3 cm in length and 0,8
    cm in. diameter, with a paratubal cyst that measures 1.3 cm; next to the paratubal
    cyst is a tan-white and firm area that. measures 0.9 cm in greatest dimension;
    at the medial end of the fallopian tube (nearest the uterus) is a tan-white and.
    tan-yellow firm mass that is attached to the paratubal soft tissue and measures
    2.2 x 2.2 cm in greatest dimension; this. mass may represent the ovary. The larger
    specimen has a somewhat serpiginous but unremarkable fallopian tube that. measures
    3.5 cm in length and 1 cm in diameter; a cystic and firm mass/ovary is attached
    to the paratubal soft tissue. and measures 5.5 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm in greatest dimension;
    sectioning the mass shows a cystic tan-yellow and golden. lesion with a trabeculated
    lining without papillary excrescences; no normal ovarian stroma is identified.

    Intraoperative Consultation: #2, section of umbilical hernia "nodule", resection
    - pick up. only. FS1 - Left ovary mass. - "Adenocarcinoma" by. Microscopic Description
    and Comment: Histologic sections from the left ovarian mass show. a poorly differentiated
    adenocarcinoma. The tumor is present predominantly in sheets of. cells with large
    vesicular nuclei and occasional tumor giant cells. In some areas the. tumor is
    present in thin single file cords invading a desmoplastic stroma. Other areas
    show. rhabdoid features with perinuclear eosinophilic cytoplasm. A significant
    minority of the. tumor forms well-defined endometrioid-type glands. These glands
    appear to be present in. an adenofibromatous stroma. Metastatic adenocarcinoma
    extensively involves the lymphatics. of the myometrium but no serosal implants
    are present. The endometrium has been entirely. submitted and exhibits a disordered
    proliferative pattern but no carcinoma is identified. The right ovary (enitrely
    submitted) and both fallopian tubes are free of carcinoma. Metastatic adenocarcinoma
    is present in periappendiceal soft tissue. The appendix also. contains a focal
    mucocele but no carcinoma involving epithelium is present. Metastatic. adenocarcinoma
    is present in 2 of 2 right external iliac lymph nodes, 2 of 2 right obturator.
    lymph nodes, lof 2 left external iliac lymph nodes, 2 of 6 left obturator lymph
    nodes, 2 of. 2 right peri-aortic lymph nodes, and 1 of 1 left peri-aortic lymph
    nodes. One right common. iliac lymph node is free of carcinoma. Poorly differentiated
    adenocarcinoma is present in. Printed from. the specimen labeled "umbilical hernia
    and nodule. The single submitted section from the. specimen labeled "small bowel
    mesenteric mass" appears to represent near total replacement. of a large lymph
    node The omentum is free of carcinoma. Given the somewhat unusual morphologic
    features immunostains were performed. The tumor is. negative for gross cystic
    disease fluid protein an antibody that stains approximately 60 to. 80% of breast
    carcinomas. The tumor is focally positive for S-100 and is strongly positive.
    for CA-125 in the better differentiated endometrioid areas. Although the morphologic.
    features and tumor distribution are somewhat unusual, in the absence of another
    primary. tumor these features are consistent with a mullerian (ovarian) primary.

    - High grade adenocarcinoma, favor Mullerian," by. Microscopic Description and
    Comment: Evaluation of the "BSO, pelvic tumor" specimen shows multiple matted
    fragments of ovarian tissue and fallopian tube all. showing extensive involvement
    by high grade serous adenocarcinoma. Of particular note, the sections of fallopian
    tube. show focal adenocarcinoma in situ within the tubal epithelium, finding that
    indicates that, formally, the disease in this. case could be due to primary ovarian
    serous adenocarcinoma, primary tubal serous adenocarcinoma, or synchronous. primary
    ovarian and tubal serous adenocarcinomas (by convention, in the absence of invasive
    disease arising within the. tubal adenocarcinoma in situ, the tumor has been designated
    an ovarian primary and the corresponding synoptic. completed). Clinical correlation
    is required. History: The patient is a. with complex pelvic masses and a CA125
    over 10,000. Operative procedure: Bilateral salpingo-cophorectomy and tumor debulking.

    and Comment: Sections of the endometrium, left ovary and omentum show mixed high
    grade serous carcinoma and endometrioid. carcinoma (overall about 60% endometrioid
    and 40% serous). There Is also high grade serous carcinoma in the. cervix, right
    ovary, peritubal soft tissue of the left fallopian tube and detached intraluminal
    fragments of high grade. serous carcinoma within the right fallopian tube. Within
    the endometrium, the carcinoma invades the myometrium and. extends to the cervical
    mucosa with stromal invasion. Whenever there is carcinoma in the ovaries and endometrium,
    it can be difficult or impossible to decide whether these. represent synchronous
    primary tumors or whether one site represents metastatic spread from another site.
    In this. case, factors that favor an endometrial primary with metastases to ovary
    and peritoneum include the presence of an. identical mixed serous and endometrioid
    morphology in both locations as well as myometrial invasion, lymphvascular. space
    invasion and cervical extension in the uterus. However, clinical correlation is

    Description and Comment: Histologic sections from the left ovarian mass show.
    a poorly differentiated Mullerian adenocarcinoma. The majority of the tumor is
    present. in solid sheets and nests. Some of the tumor, however, exhibits definite
    glandular. differentiation with occasional areas of back to back glands diagnostic
    of endometrioid. differentiation. Other areas exhibit intraluminal complexity
    in the form of papilla with. markedly pleomorphic nuclei and numerous atypical
    mitotic figures consistent with serous. differentiation. Metastatic adenocarcinoma
    is present in and around the left fallopian tube,. in a small nodule in the right
    mesovarium, extensively involving the serosal aspect of the. uterus and deep paracervical
    tissue with superficial invasion of overlying myometrium, in. the omentum, on
    the serosal aspect of the appendix, in a mesenteric nodule, in a sigmoid. nodule,
    and in the pelvis. A segment of the sigmoid colon has been resected. This segment
    is. unoriented but one resection margin exhibits metastatic adenocarcinoma. History:
    The patient is. ith a pelvic mass. now undergoes evaluation. under anesthesia,
    exploratory laparotomy, total abdominal hysterectomy, with bilateral. salpingo-oophorectomy,

    G: APPENDIX. H: OMENTUM. Gross Description Received are eight containers, each
    labeled with the patient''s name. The. first is further designated "cul de sac
    tumor. It contains a 1 x 1 x 1 cm aggregate of. friable tan tissue. The second
    container is further designated "uterus, cervix, BSO. It contains a 200. gram
    uterine corpus with attached adnexae and attached cervix. The left adnexa is largely.
    replaced by a 7 x 4 x 4 cm friable tan tumor mass. The tumor has a finely papillary.
    appearance. Attached to the tumor is a 3 cm in diameter smooth-lined cyst. Grossly,
    the. tumor appears to be adhesed and possibly invading the serosal surface of
    the left uterine. corpus. The fallopian tube, which measures 3 cm in length and
    1 cm in diameter appears to. be uninvolved, although it is adherent to the tumor
    mass. The right adnexa consists of. a. 2 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm firm white and tan ovary
    with multiple corpora albicans and a 4 cm in. length and 0.8 cm in diameter fallopian
    tube. There does not appear to be any evidence. of tumor in the fallopian tube
    or the ovary; however, in the mesovarium, there is a 0.5. cm firm white nodule.
    The uterine corpus which measures 4.5 cm superior-inferior, 4 cm. cornu-cornu,
    and 4.5 cm anterior-posterior is adhesed to the left ovarian mass. Furthermore,.
    there are multiple nodules of tumor studding the serosal surface. The endometrial
    cavity. measures 2.5 x 2 cm with an endometrial thickness of 0.2 cm. The endometrium
    sounds to a. depth of 8 cm. The endometrial lining is remarkable for a 2 x 2 X
    1 cm polyp protruding into. the endometrial cavity. Sectioning of the polyp reveals
    a central core with a firm white. lobulated appearance, measuring 2 x 1.2 x 0.5
    cm. The core of this polyp appears to arise. from the underlying myometrium and
    is consistent with a submucosal leiomyoma protruding. into the lumen of the cavity
    with an intact endometrial lining overlying the leiomyoma. There are also other
    intramural and subserosal unremarkable leiomyomas present, ranging. from 1 cm
    in greatest dimension to 1.6 cm in greatest dimension. The myometrium is 2. cm.
    in thickness anteriorly and 1.4 cm in thickness posteriorly. The cervix, which
    measures. 3 cm in length and 3 cm in diameter with a round os measuring 0.5 cm
    in diameter, appears. to be unremarkable without evidence of papillary formations,
    masses or nodules. Labeled B1. - soft tissue in area of right parametrium; B2

    \ There is an. intramural, nodular thickening measuring 2.5 x 1.8 x 0,9 cm. It\
    \ has been previously sectioned to reveal a yellow-tan. and white cut surface\
    \ which is variegated. There is another thickened area of the wall of the cyst\
    \ measuring 1.8 x 2.9. x. 1.5 cm. This may represent a portion of the round ligament\

    \ 2.4 x 2.8 x 2.4 cm. It is located at the distal end of the fallopian tube and\
    \ involves the fimbria. The cystic. ovarian mass appears to be separate from the\
    \ fallopian tube. A remnant of the ovary is not grossly identifiable. There. is.\
    \ an additional segment of fallopian tube noted measuring 1 cm in length with\
    \ a diameter of 0.4 cm. It has a pinpoint. lumen and contains no lesions. Serial\
    \ sectioning through the remainder of the fallopian tube reveals tumor within\
    \ the. lumen contiguous with the previously described tumor implant on the surface\
    \ of the fallopian tube. Proximal to the. tumor, the fallopian tube appears somewhat\
    \ dilated and filled with serosanguineous fluid. The lumen measures up to. 0.6\
    \ cm in diameter. Also present within the container is a white tissue cassette\
    \ labeled \"FS1.\" It contains fragments of. tan-yellow soft tissue, measuring\
    \ 2.2 x 1.5 x 0.2 cm in aggregate. Labeled: A1 - remnant of FS1; A2 to A4, nodular\

    \ portion of right fallopian tube. The uterus and cervix measure 7 cm from fundus\
    \ to tip of cervix x 6.3 cm from. comu to cornu x 6 cm from anterior to posterior.\
    \ The serosal surface of the uterus is tan-pink to purple. There are. possible\
    \ tumor implants noted on the posterior right aspect of the fundus, measuring\
    \ 2.3 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm. The anterior. and posterior fundic aspects of the uterus\
    \ are nodular due to the presence of subserosal and intramural probable. leiomyomas.\
    \ The cervix measures 3.5 x 3.4 x 3.4 cm. The left and posterior parametria appear\
    \ to contain tumor. implants, measuring up to 3.7 x 2,3 X 3 cm. A portion of the\
    \ peritoneal lining over the posterior aspect of the uterus and. parametria has\
    \ been partially pulled away from the parametria and uterus. There is redundant\
    \ peritoneal tissue which. may actually be a portion of a cystic structure which\
    \ has been previously opened. The exact size of this possible cystic. structure\
    \ cannot be determined. This portion of redundant peritoneal tissue ys cyst wall\
    \ tissue measures 3 cm in. greatest dimension with a thickness measuring up to\
    \ 0.3 cm. The ectocervix measures 3.4 x 3 4 cm and is tan-pink to. purple and\
    \ unremarkable. The cervical os is sfit-like and measures ~0.7 cm. The uterus\
    \ and cervix are opened to. reveal an endometrial cavity measuring 2 x 3 cm. The\
    \ endometrial cavity is somewhat deformed due to the presence of. a submucosal,\
    \ probable leiomyoma within the anterior superior segment as well as other intramural\
    \ and subserosal. leiomyomas. These leiomyomas range in size from 1.5 to 3,5 cm\
    \ in greatest dimension. They have discrete borders. and tan-white, whorled cut\
    \ surfaces. The endometrial mucosa is tan-pink to red without lesions and measures\
    \ up to 1. mm in thickness. The endocervical canal measures 2.7 x 0.7 cm with\
    \ tan-white mucosa with a herringbone contour. Also present within the container\
    \ is an ovary with attached segment of fallopian tube. The presumed right ovary\
    \ is. previously disrupted with an opening in the serosa with readily observable\
    \ tumor. Though it is rather difficult to. reconstruct the original dimensions\
    \ of the ovary, the ovary appears to measure 6 x 3,5 x 3.4 cm. The serosal surface\
    \ is. tan, grey, purple, and pink and yellow. There may be possible tumor implants\
    \ on the serosa which measure <1 mm in. height. Sectioning through the right ovary\
    \ reveals solid tumor making up 50% of the ovary as well as a cyst measuring.\
    \ 2,5 cm in diameter. The cyst is filled with tan-yellow to grey, papillary excrescences\
    \ along with blood. The more solid. component has a variegated, tan-grey and yellow\
    \ cut surface. The right fallopian tube measures 5.4 cm in length with a. diameter\
    \ ranging from 0.5 to 2 cm at the fimbriated end. The serosal surface is tan-grey\

    and Comment: Histologic sections from the right ovary show a large cyst that appears
    to be paraovarian. It is lined by benign ciliated. epithelium is most consistent
    with a benign serous cyst adenoma. On the surface of this cyst, however, are small.
    nodules of metastatic high grade serous adenocarcinoma. The bulk of the malignant
    tumor in this case is located in. the omentum with small implants on both fallopian
    tubes, left ovary, and on the serosal surface of the uterus. These. findings are
    most consistent with a primary peritoneal carcinoma. History: with ascites and
    a pelvic mass. Operative procedure: Examination under. anesthesia, exploratory
    laparotomy, Total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, infracolic.
    omentectomy, and optimal tumor debulking. Specimen(s) Received: A: RIGHT TUBE

    Description and Comment: Histologic evaluation of the ovarian mass shows poorly
    differentiated serous adenocarcinoma. While the majority of. the tumor shows typical
    serous features, focal areas have cytologic features reminiscent of neuroendocrine.
    differentiation including nuclear molding and a lack of prominent nucleoli; these
    areas also show immunoreactivity for. the neuroendocrine markers chromogranin
    and synaptophysin (immunoreactivity with pan-cytokeratin is also noted). Focal
    expression of neuroendocrine markers in serous adenocarcinoma has been described
    in the literature, however,. Examination of the specimen labeled "left pelvic
    lymph node," which was entirely submitted for histologic examination,. shows metastatic
    poorly differentlated serous adenocarcinoma. Fragments of lymphoid tissue are
    present, but there is. no definitive lymph node architecture. The findings could
    represent a lymph node that has been effaced by metastatic. disease, or a soft
    tissue tumor deposit of adenocarcinoma with a lymphocytic response. Clinical correlation
    is required. History: The patient is a. with an ovarian mass. Operative procedure:
    Exploratory laparotomy, total. abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy
    and tumor debulking. Specimen(s) Received: A: RIGHT OVARY AND TUBE. B: ANTERIOR

    tissue fragment, measuring 2x2x0.2 cm. No definitive lymphoid tissue is identified.
    Dane. 2 of F. The fourth container is labeled "left tube and ovary." It holds
    a 67 gram specimen measuring 8 x 8 X up to 5 cm. The. majority of the ovarian
    surface is involved by a tan papillary tumor. The ovary is sectioned to show extensive
    tumor. involvement. Multiple hemorrhagic cysts are also present. Along one surface
    is a 3.5 x 0.5 cm portion of fallopian tube. with no definitive serosal nodules.
    Labeled D1 - intraparenchymal and serosal involvement by tumor; D2, D3 -. additional
    sections of tumor; D4 - fallopian tube. The fifth container is labeled "uterus
    and cervix." It holds a 140 gram uterus measuring 9 cm in length, 8 cm cornu to.
    cornu, and 4 cm anterior to posterior. The bilateral adnexa are absent. The 3
    X 3.5 cm tan ectocervix has multiple. pinpoint areas of mucosal dark red congestion.
    The serosal surface has multiple serosal densities (0.1 to 0.2 cm),. present primarily
    over the posterior aspect. The 2,8 cm long endocervical canal is lined by unremarkable
    mucosa. Scattered Nabothian cysts are present. The 4 x 2.2 cm endometrial cavity
    is unremarkable. The endometrium. measures 0,2 cm thick with a myometrial thickness
    of 1.5 cm. Labeled E1 - anterior ectocervix; E2 - posterior. ectocervix; E3 -
    anterior endomyometrium; E4 - posterior endomyometrium; E5 - posterior serosal
    nodules. The sixth container is labeled "sigmold colon tumor." It holds multiple
    pieces of fibroadipose tissue measuring 2 x 1 x. 0.3 cm in aggregate. Many of
    the tissue fragments are consistent with involvement by metastatic disease. Filtered
    and. wrapped. The seventh container is labeled "anterior abdominal wall nodule."
    It holds two pieces of fibroadipose tissue measuring. 1.5 x x and 1 x nex 0.2
    cm. Both pieces have firm white densities, consistent with involvement by metastatic.
    disease. The eighth container is labeled "rectal nodule/FS2." It holds a frozen
    section remnant measuring 1 X 0.3 x 0.2 cm. Labeled H1 (FS2). The ninth container
    is labeled "omentum." It holds a piece of fibroadipose tissue measuring 20 x 10
    x 3 cm. The. specimen is studded with innumerable white firm nodules, the largest
    measuring 4,5 cm in greatest dimension. The tenth container is labeled "right
    diaphragm tumor. It holds tan, clear, thin tissue fragment measuring 0.5 x 0.5
    x. 0.1 cm. Filtered. Wrapped. The eleventh container is labeled "ileal nodule."
    it holds multiple tan-brown tissue fragments, measuring 0.7 x 0,5 x 0.2. cm, in
    aggregate. Filtered. Wrapped. The twelfth container is labeled "ileum and cecum."
    It holds an ileocolectomy specimen consisting of terminal ileum. (8.5 x 2 cm)
    and cecum (10 x 3 cm). The serosal surface and the mesenteric fat of both the
    terminal ileum and cecum. are involved by tan friable tumor nodules that range
    from 0.1 cm to 3 cm in maximal dimension. The pericecal soft. tissue is sectioned
    to show multiple lymph nodes. No appendix is identified. Labeled L1 - terminal
    ileum margin; L2. terminal ileal serosal nodule; L3 - cecal margin; L4 - additional
    section of cecum with serosal irregularity; L5 - pericecal. mass; L6 - lymph nodes.
    The thirteenth container is labeled "right pelvic nodule." It holds a slightly
    firm tan piece of fibrous tissue, measuring 1. x 0.5 x 0.2 cm. Wrapped. The fourteenth
    container is labeled "umbilicus." It holds a umbilicus specimen with a 4 X 1,5
    cm tan, hairbearing skin. ellipse with a central umbilicus measuring 1.5 X 0.1
    cm. The subcutaneous tissue is tan-yellow and measures a depth. of 3 cm. No definitive
    lesions or masses are noted. SYNOPTIC REPORTING FORM FOR MALIGNANT OVARIAN NEOPLASMS.

    \ extensively involves the 25 cm right ovary and. fallopian tube. The left fallopian\
    \ tube contains a nodule of adenocarcinoma which invades. through the fallopian\
    \ tube wall to invade the serosal surface. Areas of fallopian tube. epithelium\
    \ adjacent to this nodule show focal in situ carcinoma. The endometrium exhibits.\
    \ several apparently discrete foci of morphologically identical superficial papillary\
    \ serous. adenocarcinoma without direct myometrial invasion but with extensive\
    \ lymphvascular space. invasion. Superficial foci of papillary serous adenocarcinoma\
    \ are present in the lower. uterine segment; one is present adjacent to high endocervix.\
    \ Papillary serous adenocarcinoma. also involves the cul-de-sac biopsy, the omentum\
    \ (five small nodules measuring 1 cm in. greatest dimension), one of three right\
    \ obturator lymph nodes, three of five left external. iliac lymph nodes, two of\
    \ three right external iliac lymph nodes, and one of one para-aortic. lymph nodes.\
    \ Three left obturator lymph nodes are free of carcinoma. In cases, such as this\
    \ one, where morphologically identical papillary serous carcinoma is. present\
    \ in multiple sites it is. difficult to determine which site is the primary one\
    \ or whether there are multiple primary. sites. The extensive involvement of one\
    \ ovary, a relatively discrete lesion in the fallopian. tube with a focal area\
    \ of adjacent in situ carcinoma, and multiple foci in the endometrium. with no\
    \ myometrial invasion suggest synchronous primary sites. The presence of extensive.\
    \ lymphvascular space invasion in the myometrium, however, could provide a mechanism\
    \ for spead. of an endometrial primary. History The patient is a. year old woman\
    \ with a right adnexal mass and an enlarged uterus. Operative procedure: Examination\

    poorly differentiated papillary serous. adenocarcinoma in this case. In many areas,
    the tumor grows as. small solid nests, although there is also considerable epithelial.
    tufting and micropapillary formation. The great bulk of tumor. is. extra-ovarian
    with extensive replacement of the omentum and. involvement of the posterior cul-de-sac,
    enterocele sac, and. peri-hepatic soft tissue. The latter biopsy, submitted as
    "liver. biopsy" consists only of soft tissue; no liver parenchyma is. included
    in the sample. The ovaries are small and of normal. configuration. There are multiple
    small serosal tumor nodules and. involvement of parovarian soft tissue. Each ovary
    contains a. focus of cortical involvement measuring 4 mm and 7 mm (left and. right
    ovaries respectively) in maximum dimension. By. criteria, this degree of cortical
    involvement (any nodule. exceeding 5 mm in diameter) would be considered consistent
    with an. ovarian primary. Foci of metastatic papillary serous adenocarcinoma are
    identified. on the uterine serosa. There is a small focus of tumor in the. posterior
    para-vaginal soft tissue. The endometrium is inactive. There are no significant

    \ There is considerable involvement of the right fallopian. tube which includes\
    \ circumferential replacement of the mucosa and. muscularis with extension through\
    \ the serosal surface. The normal. mucosal epithelium is largely obliterated by\
    \ this process, but. focally, an in-situ component is identified. There is extensive.\

    \ in size and configuration. Microscopically,. small. tumor foci are identified\
    \ on the ovarian surface and within. scattered lymphvascular spaces. There is\
    \ one confluent nodule of. tumor situated in the ovarian hilum and medulla. While\

    vein. The pleural surface of the. lung is intact with a finely stippled anthracotic
    pigment present. No obvious areas of puckering of the pleura or umbilication are.
    evident. Several small possible peribronchial lymph nodes are. present adjacent
    to the bronchial stump. There is a mass that is. palpable in the interlobar fissure.
    This appears to be below the. surface of the lung. Sections are placed through
    the mass and this. reveals a large tumor mass which is immediately inferior to
    the main. bronchus. The tumor mass measures maximally 6 X 5 X 4 cm. It. arises
    approximately 1 cm below the bronchial cuff margin that. grossly does not appear

    VASCULAR/LYMPHATIC INVASION PRESENT. PROSTATIC INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA (PIN),
    HIGH GRADE. COMMENT. The prostate gland contains three foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma.
    All tumor foci are located in the peripheral zone. The. dominant tumor focus is
    located in the right anterior, right anterolateral, right lateral, right posterolateral,
    right posterior, mid. posterior and left posterior peripheral zone with extension
    into the right transition zone. This tumor focus measures 2.6 x 1.6 cm in. the
    largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in the three cross sections
    of the prostate and extensively in the apex and. base. regions. The tumor exhibits
    extraprostatic extension in the right lateral surface of the prostate, right superior
    neurovascular. bundle region and base region anterior to the right seminal vesicle.
    At the site of extraprostatic extension, the margin of resection. is. free. of.
    tumor. In the anterior apical region, tumor extends to the inked margin of resection.
    The extent of the positive margin is. 4.0 mm. At the site of the positive margin,
    no extraprostatic tissue is present to identify the possible presence of extraprostatic.
    extension. This. tumor focus invades the right seminal vesicle (intraprostatic
    and extraprostatic portions) and left seminal vesicle. (intraprostatic portion).
    Vascular lymphatic invasion is present within the prostate as well as within the
    intraprostatic portion of the. left. seminal. vesicle. The second tumor focus
    is located in the left lateral and left posterolateral peripheral zone. This tumor
    focus. measures 0.6 x 0.4 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is
    present in the first cross section of the prostate and focally. in. the apical
    region. The third tumor focus is located in the left lateral and left posterolateral
    peripheral zone, This tumor focus. measures 0.7 x 0.3 cm in the largest cross-sectional
    dimension and it is present in the last cross section of the prostate. The. non-dominant
    tumor foci are of lower histologic grade and confined to the prostate with negative
    margins. GROSS DESCRIPTION. (D) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting
    of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and. attached segments
    of right and left vasa deferentia. The prostate gland (4.4 x 3.1 X 3.2 cm, 33
    grams, post-fixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the.
    right posterolateral aspect of the prostate appears more abundant than along the

    focus although not the one of the highest histologic grade (Gleason score 5/3+2)
    located in the right and. left transition zone. This tumor focus measures 2.7

    cross. sections and focally in the apical region. This tumor focus is confined
    to the prostate and the margins of resection are free. of. tumor. The second tumor
    focus is located in the left lateral, left posterolateral, left posterior, mid
    posterior and right posterior. peripheral zone. This tumor focus measures 2.2
    x 1.5 cm in the largest cross sectional dimension and it is present in three cross.
    sections, extensively in the apex and focally in the base region. This tumor focus
    is a high grade carcinoma (Gleason score 4+5). and. is. associated with an increased

    is present in two separate sections and the added length of. extraprostatic tumor
    is 9.0 mm. At the site of extraprostatic extension the margins of resection are
    free of tumor. This tumor focus. focally extends to less than 0.1 mm from the
    margin of resection in the apex. This tumor focus invades the intraprostatic portion
    of. the left seminal vesicle. Due to the presence of distortion in areas of the
    tumor close to the margins of resection in the apex and the presence of a marked.
    lymphocytic infiltrate, immunoperoxidase studies for keratin, lymphocyte marker
    and neuroendocrine differentiation markers were. performed. Cytokeratin highlights
    tumor which is seen focally approaching but not at the margins of resection. The
    lymphocytic. infiltrate is a mixture of both CD20 positive B lymphocytes and CD5
    positive T lymphocytes with a predominance of the latter. The. tumor is negative
    for synaptophysin but a few scattered neoplastic cells are positive for chromogranir
    supporting the presence of. focal minimal neuroendocrine differentiation. Page:

    DIAGNOSIS COMMENT: This supplemental report is being issued to provide the final.
    diagnosis for parts A and B after consultation with. and after performing a FISH
    study to rule out Xp11.2. translocation-associated renal cell carcinoma. The tumor
    exhibits a predominant papillary architecture, lined by. cells with a variably
    eosinophilic to clear cytoplasm. Areas with. solid pattern of growth, also with
    clear cell features, are present. Scattered calcifications are seen. Within the
    solid areas, some. tumor cells exhibit spindling and atypia, compatible with focal.
    tumor cells are positive for cytokeratin 7, EMA (focal),. sarcomatoid de-differentiation.
    Immunohistochemical stains racemase for the. (p504s), vimentin and PAX-8 (focal)
    A stain for p63 is negative. The overall cytoarchitectural features and immunohistochemical.
    profile are compatible with a papillary renal cell carcinoma, type. 2. Although
    focal areas are suggestive of Xp11 translocation. carcinoma, the immunohistochemical
    profile (positivity for EMA and. cytokeratin 7) do not support this impression,
    and FISH for the. detection of rearrangement of the TFE3 gene locus at chromosome.

    Nuclear grade (Fuhrman, 1-4) : 3. Tumor size: 4.2 x 3.5 x 3.5 cm. Tumor site Lower
    pole. Tumor focality: Unifocal. Sarcomatoid features: Not identified. Tumor necrosis:
    Present (10% of tumor). Macroscopic extent of tumor: Tumor involves renal vein
    and. perinephric (including periadrenal) adipose tissue. Microscopic tumor extension:
    Tumor involves wall of renal vein. and invades perinephric and periadrenal adipose
    tissue. Surgical margins: Free of tumor. Lymphovascular invasion: Present. Lymph

    identified. Original Diagnosis Comment. The morphologic features of the tumor
    are unusual. The tumor. exhibits a predominant papillary architecture, lined by
    cells with a. variably eosinophilic to clear cytoplasm. Areas with solid pattern.
    of growth, also with clear cell features, are present. Scattered. calcifications
    are seen. Within the solid areas, some tumor cells. exhibit spindling and atypia;
    however, no definitive sarcomatoid. de-differentiation is identified. Immunohistochemical
    stains for the tumor cells are positive for. cytokeratin 7, EMA (focal), racemase
    (p504s), vimentin and PAX-8. (focal) A stain for p63 is negative. The overall
    cytoarchitectural features and immunohistochemical. profile are compatible with
    a renal cell carcinoma; subtyping of the. tumor is difficult. The tumor predominantly
    exhibits features of a. papillary renal cell carcinoma (type 2) Although focal
    areas are. suggestive of Xp11 translocation carcinoma, the immunohistochemical.
    profile (positivity for EMA and cytokeratin 7) do not support this. impression.
    This case will be sent to. for. expert consultation. Their findings and final
    diagnosis will be. reported in a supplemental report. Original Gross Description.
